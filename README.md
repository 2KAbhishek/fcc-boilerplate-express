<h3>Basic Node and Express üåè‚è©</h3>

</div>

## What is this

This repo contains the project created for FreeCodeCamp's [Basic Node and Express](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#basic-node-and-express), part of the Back-End Development track.

## Inspiration

Wanted to finish the Back-End Development curriculum.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `node`

## Getting fcc-boilerplate-express

To install fcc-boilerplate-express, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/fcc-boilerplate-express
cd fcc-boilerplate-express
```

## Using fcc-boilerplate-express

This repo was created to help new developers get started with express and basic API development, and to help people who are trying to complete FCC's Back-End Development certification.

Go through the commit history of this repo to understand the solutions to different exercises.

To run the app locally: `npm start`

## How it was built

fcc-boilerplate-express was built using [boilerplate-express](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-express/) as a starting point.

## Challenges faced

- Not a challenge but a learning experience, in order to make tests that depend on the environment variables, we have to update the .env file on Glitch as well.

## What I learned

- Got to learn about middleware.
- Worked with middleware like body-parser.
- Learned about different ways to handle routes and parameters.

## What's next

Planning to finish the Back-end Certification.
